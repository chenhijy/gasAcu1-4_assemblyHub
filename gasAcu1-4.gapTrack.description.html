<p>This track depicts gaps in the genome assembly as black boxes. In the FASTA sequence, these assembly gaps are stretches of <code>N</code>s.</p>
<p>The assembly gaps were computed with a command like the following:</p>
<code><p>twoBitInfo -nBed gasAcu1-4.2bit stdout | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > gapTrack.bed</p></code>
