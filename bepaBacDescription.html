<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The stickleback reference genome was generated from DNA libraries with a
variety of different insert sizes, all constructed from a single female fish
from Bear Paw Lake, Alaska (Jones et al. 2012 Nature 484: 55-61). This track
shows (end) read placements from two large insert Bacterial Artificial
Chromosome (BAC) clone libraries made from the reference individual. For more
details about the libraries themselves, see the <a href="https://bacpacresources.org/library.php?id=104">CHORI-213</a>
and <a href="https://bacpacresources.org/library.php?id=167">CHORI-215</a>
 information pages at BACPAC Resources. To build this sticklebrowser track, over three hundred thousand (end)
sequence reads generated from BAC clones at Broad Institute were trimmed based
on sequence quality (Pred), placed against the original <code>gasAcu1</code> stickleback reference genome assembly
using BLAT, and filtered to retain only those placements whose second-highest
hit scores were significantly lower (&lt;70%) than the highest hit score. These placements were then lifted to <code>gasAcu1-4</code>. The
individual BAC (end) reads can also be found by searching in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore">NCBI Nucleotide Database</a> for "CHORI-213" and "CHORI-215".</p>


<p>You can use the names of individual clones shown in the track to order physical
copies of the corresponding BAC clones from the frozen CHORI-213 and CHORI-215
libraries. Clones from the reference stickleback libraries are maintained and
distributed by <a href="https://bacpacresources.org/">BACPAC Resources Center</a>.
