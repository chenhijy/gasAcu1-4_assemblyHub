<h3>Description</h3>

In order to annotate <code>gasAcu1-4</code> with quantitative trait loci (QTL), we began with all QTLs from the comprehensive 2017 review of all reported stickleback QTLs by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0486">Marques and Peichel</a>. We first filtered out results from stickleback species other than Gasterosteus aculeatus, and then for each reported interval lifted the coordinates from <code>gasAcu1</code> to <code>gasAcu1-4</code>. Finally, to create a set of well-bounded major QTL, we required each QTL to have PVE &gt; 20 and have a reported confidence interval &lt; 5Mb. All markers on chrP were assigned to the end of <code>chrVII</code>, where <em>Pitx1</em> physically resides. No filtering was performed on account of trait similarity within a cross or multiple crosses analyzing the same trait. This yielded 108 major QTLs. Some loci contain more overlapping QTL reports than visualized in <b>Fig. 1G</b> of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abg5285">Roberts Kingman et al. 2021</a>.
