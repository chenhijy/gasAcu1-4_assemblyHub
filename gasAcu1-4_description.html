<p>The assembly <code>gasAcu1-4</code> is a new version of the threespine stickleback reference genome. It only minorly differs from the <a href="=https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esx058">2017 Hi-C guided assembly generated by Peichel, Sullivan, Liachko, and White</a> to improve the subtelomeric <em>Pitx1</em> locus and the mitochondrial genome.</p>

<p>The subtelomeric region of <code>chrVII</code> is of great biological interest due to its well-documented role in controlling pelvic spine development (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02415">Shapiro et al. 2004</a>). However, due to its highly repetitive nature, it is extremely difficult to assemble and many important sequences, including the key gene <em>Pitx1</em>, are missing entirely from existing genome assemblies, while other sequences in the region are scattered in small unassembled scaffolds. We address this issue by including the sequence from Salmon River BAC clones (Genbank GU130435) (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1182213">Chan et al. 2010</a>) as <code>chrP</code> and removing overlapping fragmented sequences from <code>chrUn</code> and the end of <code>chrVII</code>. We note that <code>chrP</code> is derived from a marine population, while the rest of the genome is from a freshwater population (Bear Paw Lake), so all analyses concerning this chromosome must be interpreted as such.</p>

<p>The mitochondrial genome was previously split into two fragments buried within <code>chrUn</code>, while a separate mitochondrial genome sequence from Northern Japan was added as <code>chrM</code>. We corrected these issues by removing the duplicated Bear Paw Lake mitochondrial genome from <code>chrUn</code> and using it to replace the exogenous <code>chrM</code> sequence, resulting in a single copy of the mitochondrial genome derived entirely from Bear Paw Lake.</p>

<p>Aside from these changes, the <a href="=https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esx058">Peichel et al. 2017</a> reference genome was not modified in any other ways.</p>
