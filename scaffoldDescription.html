<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Genome sequencing projects are jigsaw puzzles with millions of pieces. The primary sequence data are short sequence reads made up of strings of A, C, G, and Ts. Many of these sequences overlap with each other, and can be aligned to produce longer continuous strings of sequence, called "contigs". Adjacent "contigs" can be bridged into larger "scaffolds", based on bridging clones whose end sequences map to different contigs. Finally, the larger "scaffolds" can be roughly positioned on chromosomes by following the inheritance pattern of genetic sequences in families.</p>

<p>This track depicts the scaffolds generated during the assembly of gasAcu1, which were then lifted to gasAcu1-4.</p>
