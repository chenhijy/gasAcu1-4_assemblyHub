<h3>Description</h3>

These tracks represent results from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abg5285">Roberts Kingman et al. 2021</a>. The study authors use repeated evolution in stickleback to identify a large set of genomic loci that change recurrently during colonization of freshwater habitats by marine fish. The same loci used repeatedly in long-established extant populations (EcoPeak intervals) also show rapid allele frequency changes (in TempoPeak intervals) when new freshwater populations are experimentally established from marine ancestors. Please refer to the description of each individual track as well as the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abg5285">published manuscript</a> for more detailed information.
